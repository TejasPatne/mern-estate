## Infinite Scroll

The application implements an infinite scroll feature for property listings. Instead of traditional pagination, where you click through pages, this feature allows you to continuously load more listings as you scroll down the page, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Firebase Image Storage and Google OAuth Integration

- **Firebase Image Storage:** Property images are securely stored using Firebase Storage, ensuring efficient and reliable access to images for the listings.

- **Google OAuth Integration:** User authentication is handled seamlessly through Firebase Authentication, allowing users to log in securely using their Google credentials. This integration enhances security and simplifies the user login experience.

## Redux Toolkit for Global State Management

- **Redux Toolkit:** The application utilizes Redux Toolkit for global state management, providing a predictable and efficient way to manage the application's state.

## Protected Routes and Pages

- **Protected Routes:** Certain routes and pages are protected to ensure that only authenticated users can access them. This enhances the overall security of the application and protects sensitive information.

## Profile Update

- **Profile Update:** Users have the ability to update their profiles, allowing them to personalize and manage their information within the application.

## Advanced Search

- **Advanced Search:** The application features a modern sidebar with advanced search functionality, enabling users to search by title, limit search results, and apply sorting options to find properties that match their criteria.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TejasPatne/mern-estate.git
   cd mern-estate
   ```

2. **Create a .env file in the root folder:**

   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>
   JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT Secret>
   ```
   Replace <Your MongoDB URI> and <Your JWT Secret> with your actual MongoDB connection string and a secret key for JWT token generation.

3. **Create a .env file in the client folder:**

   ```
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies and Run the Application:**

   In the root folder:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command will install the necessary dependencies for both the API (backend) and the client (frontend) and run them concurrently.

5. **Create a New Terminal and Navigate to the Client Folder:**

   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
